# e-testdrive
Super simple vehicle test drive script for everyone!

# Functions

- When player ends a test drive their health is returned to the orginal status.
- After time runs out or player exits the vehicle (F) the player gets teleported back to the zone.

# Requirements

This script was created just for the people that need a very simple test driving script. 
I might create a V2 of this and make it more advanced with more buttons and a UI
